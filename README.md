Hello gamer! 🦊

Foxy is a video game collection & review site that showcases your love of gaming to your friends & the world! 🎮

Upon becoming a user through logging in via Google OAuth (using your pre-existing Google or Gmail credentials) --- this app offers full CRUD functionality on its library of games. 

Users may create any game that is not currently on the site, and then have access to edit & delete functionality on the game or its details. Users may also add reviews to any game in the library as well, whether they created that game or not. A user may also add whatever game that currently exists in the library to pin to their profile, to show off select games they deem as their favorites! 😄
